# Computer-Vision-Based-Waste-Management-System
This project is under the Course No ECE 4102 and Title : Industrial and power electronics Sessional

The project is Supervised by
Dr. Md. Shamim Ahsan, 
Professor, 
Electronics and Communication Engineering Discipline, 
Khulna University,  Khulna, Bangladesh.

# Objectives:
• Develop a computer vision-based system capable of accurately identifying and
classifying various types of waste, including plastic, metal, wood, and others.
• Design and implement a robust mechanism using stepper motors to open the
appropriate bin based on the identified waste type.
• Integrate sensors within the bins to detect and monitor fill levels, providing real-time
data for waste collection scheduling and optimization.
